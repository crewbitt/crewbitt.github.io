			<p><i>Red wire: right temple. Black wire: left temple.</i></p>
			<p>As a math nerd, The Dismemberment Plan’s 1999 magnum opus was a perfect addition to the arsenal of my college soundtrack. It is elliptical and trigonometric, words I rarely get to use in an artistic context. </p>
			<p id="ref1">When music is so mathematical, I worry that explaining it as such will misrepresent it. Doesn’t it sound so… boring? Nobody wants to listen to math rock, for example, because it’s so terribly named<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a>. </p>
			<p>But if we understand mathematics as making sense from chaos, <i>Emergency & I</i> is as mathematical as mathematical gets. Wild guitars rage like waves crashing against one another in the middle of the ocean, drums echo across an empty plane. It has its frigid moments: “The Jitters” is slow and ringing, a depressed march forward. And it has its warm moments, too, like the organic and flowing “Back and Forth.”</p>
			<p>Songs like “Back and Forth” and “Gyroscope” are fantastic studies in music that actually feels like its lyrics. There is no dissonance in the latter’s chorus, a swirling fray made even more gyroscopic when singer Travis Morrison’s voice wildly, delightfully undulates. It is geometric without ever being cold, and carries a precision that is still abundantly human.</p>
			<p>This is what <i>Pinkerton</i> wishes it could be. Or, better yet, this is the album Weezer fans think <i>Pinkerton</i> is. It carries the sadness and bitterness of love and loss in your twenties without resentment or anger. It doesn’t condemn or condone pain or pleasure: instead, it analytically describes them.</p>
			<p id="ref2">This analytic mindset bleeds into the album as a whole. It is an actual antidote to chaos<a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a>. The cover calls to mind Dali’s <i>The Persistence of Memory</i>, but, frankly, the music reminds me more of <i>Nature Morte Vivante</i>. It exists in a flat but frenzied space, with carefully chosen sounds delivered with the confidence of improvised naturalism. </p>

			<p>The album operates like a clock, mechanical and careful, and this is thanks in no small part to drummer Joe Easley. He is a machine. So much so, in fact, that I didn’t even realize an organic drummer was behind the album until my second or third listen. Even fast, complex tracks like “I Love A Magician” are no problem for Easley, who rides through them with ease.</p>
			<p>Morrison, too, is frenetic and deeply entrenched in the music. His voice doesn’t just jump from place to place — it teleports, in classic sci-fi fashion. Not just from song to song, or even sentence to sentence — any note could be different from the last, and the unpredictability of Morrison’s voice sticks around even for repeat listens. </p>
			<p>And believe me, there have been plenty of repeat listens. <i>Emergency & I</i> is one of those albums I can’t always stand to listen to. Sometimes, it’s grating or annoying. But when I’m in the mood, I can find the space to really appreciate everything going on on this album — and how could I ever not be entranced by “You Are Invited”?</p>
