			<h4> Starting a Website </h4>
			<p> This was a weird summer. </p>
			<p> Trying to find a job was always going to be hard, but now it feels impossible. I keep questioning whether I should have stayed in college for a fourth year instead of graduating early. I look at my friends still in college and find myself relieved that I don't have to worry about potentially cancelling housing or trying to figure out to what extent the university even plans on reopening. </p>
			<p> Still, that doesn't mean summer has been easy. The anxiety of school has been replaced by that of the job search. Eventually, I realized about half the jobs I wanted to apply for asked for experience with SQL. I had never even heard of SQL, but it seemed pretty easy to pick up.</p>
			<p> The thing was, I wanted a place to show off any SQL projects I did in the future. Not only that, but I had a dozen or so half-baked project ideas rattling around in my head with nowhere to go. With these facts in mind, I dusted off my HTML book, sat down and cobbled together this website.</p>
			<p> It seems more important than ever to have a corner of the internet to serve your personal brand. I like the idea that I have my own little plot of land that I can alter as I please. The lack of oversight is freeing, even if it does mean I might occasionally misspell things. </p>
			<p>I might delete it someday. Hell, I might delete it as soon as one of my friends looks my name up and finds this and mentions it to me.</p>
			<p>I'll keep it for now, though.</p>
